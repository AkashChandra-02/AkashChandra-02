	<p><h5>Introduction</h5></p><p>I wanted to design and build something that didn't rely on my computer or the RTL-SDR. 
	Since my friends had radios that worked on the GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) band, I decided that I would try to display the location of GMRS radios relative to the user with a 12 pixel neopixel ring.</p>

	<p>The antenna will have a spinning cover that will expose a section of the surrounding. Using the MOSFET and photointerrupter, I can time how long it takes for a certain </p>
	
	<p><h5>Development</h5></p>
	<p>I started with the Arduino sketch, since I was still trying to design the amplifer and envelope detector to feed into the Arduino. The first step I took was to get the Neopixel ring working based off of the given sketches. 
	After I blinded myself with the Neopixel, I started to write the sketch. </p>
