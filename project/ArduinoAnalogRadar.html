	<h1>Arduino Analog Radar</h1>
	
	<p><h5>Introduction</h5></p><p>I wanted to design and build something that didn't rely on my computer or the RTL-SDR. 
	Since my friends had radios that worked on the GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) band, I decided that I would try to display the location of GMRS radios relative to you using a 12 pixel neopixel ring.</p>
	
	<p><h5>Development</h5></p>
	<p>The system I designed was to have an antenna that feeds into an amplifer, that then goes throgh an envelope detector, then to the Arduino.</p>
	<p>I started with the Arduino sketch, since I was still trying to design the amplifer and envelope detector to feed into the Arduino. The first step I took was to get the Neopixel ring working based off of the given sketches.</p>
	
	<p><b>Source Code:</b> The Arduino sketch can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/AkashChandra-02/ArduinoAnalogRadar">AkashChandra-02/ArduinoAnalogRadar</a>.</p>
